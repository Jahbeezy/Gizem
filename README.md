## Description

    For this project I needed to write the javascript to create a functioning password generator that would allow you to randomly produce passwords with upper and lower case letters as well as symbols and numbers. I learned how to create a working generate button that checks the parameters specified by check boxes and a range slider. Also, I was able to call a funtion to run in another function allowing the generated password to display. 

## Installation

* copy ssh key from [https://github.com/Jahbeezy/Gizem] and use git clone to download the file.

## Usage

* Open up the webpage [https://jahbeezy.github.io/Gizem/]
and select atleast one of the parameters.
* Slide the Character Amount to desired number
* Use Copy button to copy the password to your clipboard
